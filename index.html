		 I started out as a Business Analyst using UML to document technical procedures and processes.  When the need for documentation ran out, I moved to the IT Operations department managing the Help Desk which opened up a lot of opportunities for me.  By assigning myself service desk tickets, I became exposed to many facets of the IT world: database administration including SQL and SQL Server, Postgresql, FTP and SFTP file transmissions, SSL and SSH encryption, private and public key management, PGP encryption, Active Directory, Perl, Ruby, Powershell, VI and VIM, Debian based Linux distros like Linux Ubuntu and Linux Mint, Bash, and even a little networking with Cisco routers and switches.  My troubleshooting skills have vastly improved as well; I have learned what to expect from a network/software and how to help users outside of the IT world integrate with that infrastructure.
